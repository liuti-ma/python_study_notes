Virtual Bookshelf

ave you ever wanted to keep track of the books you have read and give each book a rating?

This is not a new concept and there are plenty of companies that have built something for exactly this purpose.

e.g. https://www.librarything.com/

But in order to do this, we will need to learn how to use a database. By the end of today, you will have learnt how to create an SQLite database and how to create, read, update and delete data in the database.

On Windows type:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
On MacOS type:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
