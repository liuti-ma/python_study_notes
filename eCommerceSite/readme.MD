Key Features to Implement
User Authentication

Product Catalog

Shopping Cart

Stripe Checkout

Order History

Implementation Steps
1. Setup and Configuration

Key Considerations
Security:

Never store raw passwords (always hash with bcrypt)

Use HTTPS in production

Keep Stripe API keys secret

User Experience:

Clear feedback during checkout

Responsive design for mobile users

Order confirmation emails (can add with Flask-Mail)

Scalability:

Consider pagination for product listings

Database indexing for performance

Caching for frequently accessed products

This implementation provides a solid foundation that you can extend with additional features like product categories, reviews, discounts, and more complex inventory management.
